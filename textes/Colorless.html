    <h1>Textes</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>
            Colorless
        </h2>
        <pre>
            I'm broken glass
            I may be beautiful
            But the rays of light
            Aren't making me feel full

            Being happy doesn't mean anything
            If nobody around you see a thing
            Yet they blame you for all you are
            They just can't see how much you made it far

            One single crack is all it takes
            To make them see a slacker
            Can only survive if you're a withstander
            Keeping the calmness of the lakes

            They speak as if they figured it out
            But I'm just burnt-out
            I do not seek glory
            I only seek to be happy

            Can I keep my colors
            without being made ashamed of it?
        </pre>
